This repository represents my first crack at using binaries and the bit syntax.
I chose to read DHCP entries from a libpcap file because the format is well documented
and great tools exist to make pcap files, as well as determine their
contents (wireshark).

I was working on a project involving DHCP and decided that this would be a good way 
for me to refresh my memory about DHCP and expand my erlang chops.  This code is
just for play.  I'm new to erlang.
